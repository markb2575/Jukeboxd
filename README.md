# Local Development For Front End
* **Make sure npm command is usable on system**
* Open a terminal inside the root of the frontend directory
* Use `npm install` to install node_modules needed to run project.
* Use `npm start` to run project.
* When making pushes to GitHub don't push any node_modules because they take up a lot of space and can be installed with `npm install`
